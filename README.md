 **Pipe (`last2.c`)**

* Uses **unnamed pipes** for **unidirectional communication** between parent and child.
* The **parent writes** a formatted string to the pipe.
* The **child reads** and displays it.
* The message is temporarily stored in a character buffer (`char inbuf[]`).

## ðŸ§  Key Differences

| Feature           | Message Queue (`msgq.c`)            | Pipe (`last2.c`)                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Direction         | Bi-directional (if implemented)     | One-way (Parent â†’ Child)            |
| Structure Support | Structured messages via `struct`    | Only raw byte streams (strings)     |
| Persistence       | Can persist beyond process lifetime | Temporary (gone after program ends) |
| Identification    | Identified by a key (`ftok`)        | Uses file descriptors (`pipe()`)    |
| Suitable For      | Complex/multi-process messaging     | Simple parent-child communication   |
