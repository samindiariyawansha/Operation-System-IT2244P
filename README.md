### Description:
This script calculates the **LCM** of two numbers (a, b) and the **GCD** of another pair (b, c) based on user input.

### Purpose:
It demonstrates how to compute the **Least Common Multiple (LCM)** and **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)** of numbers, which are useful in problems involving divisibility and fractions.# Operation-System-IT2244P


# ðŸ§® Shell Script: LCM and GCD Calculation

### âœ… **Objective:**

* Read three numbers from the user (`a`, `b`, and `c`)
* Calculate:

  * **LCM** (Least Common Multiple) of `a` and `b`
  * **GCD** (Greatest Common Divisor) of `b` and `c`

### ðŸ§ª **Run the script:**

```bash
$ vi Q1_40.sh
$ chmod 777 Q1_40.sh
$ ./Q1_40.sh
```

---

### ðŸ’¡ **Example Execution:**

```
Enter the first number (a):
8
Enter the second number (b):
6
Enter the third number (c):
2
LCM of 8 and 6 is 24
GCD of 6 and 2 is 2
```

---

### ðŸ“Œ Notes:

* **LCM** is calculated using the formula:

  $$
  \text{LCM}(a, b) = \frac{a \times b}{\text{GCD}(a, b)}
  $$
* **GCD** is found using the **Euclidean Algorithm**.
