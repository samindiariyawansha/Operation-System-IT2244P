✅ awk and sed Commands
You ran:

awk

sed

These commands showed their usage manuals because you didn’t provide the required arguments. They work like this:

awk '{print $1}' filename: prints the first column of each line in a file.

sed 's/foo/bar/' filename: substitutes the first occurrence of "foo" with "bar" in each line.

✅ find
You used find with no options, so it listed files and directories in the current directory (default behavior).

✅ ls -a and ls -ltr
These both worked. ls -a showed hidden files like .bashrc, and ls -ltr showed the most recently modified files (in this case, only new.txt).

✅ cd
Used alone, cd returns you to the home directory, which is normal behavior.
