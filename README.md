This C program demonstrates the use of process creation using `fork()` in a Unix-like environment. Upon execution, it asks the user to input three integers and performs the following tasks concurrently using child processes:

- **Calculate the factorial** of the first number.
- **Generate the Fibonacci sequence** up to the second number.
- **Display all prime numbers** up to the third number.

Each of these tasks runs in its own process or subprocess to showcase process management and parallel execution.
